\subsubsection*{Aims:}
Use AI to improve realism, immersion, and to assist learning

\subsubsection{Objectives:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Investigate how \acrshort{ai} models can interact with students during cyber security training scenarios
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Setup and test chatbots acting as employees and thread actors in challenges
        \item Test the ability of \acrshort{llm}s to give hints and tips without giving away complete answers
    \end{itemize}
    \item Investigate the use of AI models to generate scenarios for use in Cyber Security training simulations
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Determine if \acrshort{llm}s are suitable for generating malware for students to analyze
        \item Demonstrate using LLMs to generate narrative content for scenarios in an automated fashion
    \end{itemize}
